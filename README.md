# 📰 L8ttest-Buz — Smaseko’s One-Page News Website

Welcome to **L8ttest-Buz**, a simple and clean one-page news website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — hosted completely free on **GitHub Pages** using **Termux**.

This site automatically fetches and displays the **latest global news** from the [NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io/) API in real-time, and is updated every time the page loads.

## 🪄 How It Works
1. HTML + CSS define the structure and design  
2. JavaScript calls the NewsData.io API:
   ```
   https://newsdata.io/api/1/news?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&country=us&language=en
   ```
3. Results are displayed dynamically in the “Latest News” section  
4. The site auto-refreshes news every time the page loads
